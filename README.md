# JavaScript Tasks Explanation

## Task Explanations

### **Ex 3: Save User Answers and Loop Through Array**
1. **Objective**: Create a program that collects user data ([username, gender, sandwich name]) and saves it in an array. Then, use a `for` loop to print each element of the array.
2. **Steps**:
   - Create input fields for the user to enter data.
   - Save the collected data into an array.
   - Create a function to handle the gender question.
   - Use a `for` loop to iterate through the array and print the elements using `console.log`.



### **Q2: Odd or Even Numbers**
1. **Objective**: Use a loop to check if numbers from 0 to 15 are odd or even.
2. **Steps**:
   - Use a `for` loop to iterate from 0 to 15.
   - Use the modulo operator `%` to check if a number is divisible by 2.
   - Print whether the number is odd or even.



### **Q4: Insert Dashes Between Even Numbers**
1. **Objective**: Insert dashes (`-`) between each pair of even numbers in a given number.
2. **Steps**:
   - Convert the number to a string.
   - Iterate through the string using a loop.
   - Check if the current and next characters are even.
   - If both are even, add a dash between them.

### **Q5: Age Checker**
1. **Objective**: Create a function to check if the user is an adult or a minor based on their age.
2. **Steps**:
   - Use a function that accepts an age as input.
